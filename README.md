# Recipes classifier using NLP

# Presentation

The objective of this project was to build a model capable of predicting the country of origin of a given recipe. This is an NLP classification problem, as each recipe is described by its list of ingredients.

This project has been done in three parts:

1. Cleaning and tokenization of the raw database.
2. Binarization of the data.
3. Training and comparison of different classification models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.
